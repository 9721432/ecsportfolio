<h4>Timeline</h4>
<li>2020- 2020 was my first ever year skateboarding and was a big stepping stone as to why I skateboard to this day. I started skateboarding because I was bored during the pandemic and had nothing 
better to do. My dad got me into skateboarding and is a big reason I started.</li>
 <li>2021- In 2021 I really started to progress and I got a lot more comfortable on my skateboard. This was a really good and important year because I got my first sponser (Neighborhood Skateboarding).
 I progressed a ton this year and i got way more confident.</li>
 <li>2022- This was one of my hardest years skateboarding because I got hurt a lot. Early in the year I broke my wrist and was out for a while. Later that year I broke my ankle and I thought that I was
 Going to be done skateboarding forever.</li>
 <li>2023- In 2023 when I was all healed from breaking my ankle I decided to start skateboarding again. This was my best year skateboarding yet. I cam back better then ever and progressed so much. Later
 this year I got my dream sponser and was having a lot of fun skateboarding. I made so many freinds through skateboarding and this was my favorite year.</li>
 <li>2024- This was also a really good year where I progressed a lot but not as much as in 2023. This year is when I started competing. I competed in many competitions and even went to finals! I was top
 10 in state. I got a lot more confident this year too.</li>
 <li>2025- The year just started and im looking forward to what happens in the future and I am hoping that I will get a bigger sponser than I have now.</li>
